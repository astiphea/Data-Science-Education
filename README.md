Educational Resources for Data Science


Principles, Statistical and Computational Tools for Reproducible Data Science
Learn skills and tools that support data science and reproducible research, to ensure you can trust your own research results, reproduce them yourself, and communicate them to others.
What you'll learn
Understand a series of concepts, thought patterns, analysis paradigms, and computational and statistical tools, that together support data science and reproducible research.
Fundamentals of reproducible science using case studies that illustrate various practices.
Key elements for ensuring data provenance and reproducible experimental design.
Statistical methods for reproducible data analysis.
Computational tools for reproducible data analysis and version control (Git/GitHub, Emacs/RStudio/Spyder), reproducible data (Data repositories/Dataverse) and reproducible dynamic report generation (Rmarkdown/R Notebook/Jupyter/Pandoc), and workflows.
How to develop new methods and tools for reproducible research and reporting, and how to write your own reproducible paper.

Course description
What do you know about TinyML? Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) is one of the fastest-growing areas of Deep Learning and is rapidly becoming more accessible. This course provides a foundation for you to understand this emerging field.
TinyML is at the intersection of embedded Machine Learning (ML) applications, algorithms, hardware, and software. TinyML differs from mainstream machine learning (e.g., server and cloud) in that it requires not only software expertise, but also embedded-hardware expertise.
The first course in the TinyML Certificate series, Fundamentals of TinyML will focus on the basics of machine learning, deep learning, and embedded devices and systems, such as smartphones and other tiny devices. Throughout the course, you will learn data science techniques for collecting data and develop an understanding of learning algorithms to train basic machine learning models. 
At the end of this course, you will be able to understand the “language” behind TinyML and be ready to dive into the application of TinyML in future courses.
Following Fundamentals of TinyML, the other courses in the TinyML Professional Certificate program will allow you to see the code behind widely-used Tiny ML applications—such as tiny devices and smartphones—and deploy code to your own physical TinyML device. Fundamentals of TinyML provides an introduction to TinyML and is not a prerequisite for Applications of TinyML or Deploying TinyML for those with sufficient machine learning and embedded systems experience

Course description
We will learn the basics of statistical inference in order to understand and compute p-values and confidence intervals, all while analyzing data with R. 
We provide R programming examples in a way that will help make the connection between concepts and implementation. 
Problem sets requiring R programming will be used to test understanding and ability to implement basic data analyses. 
We will use visualization techniques to explore new data sets and determine the most appropriate approach. We will describe robust statistical techniques as alternatives when data do not fit assumptions required by the standard approaches. By using R scripts to analyze data, you will learn the basics of conducting reproducible research.

Given the diversity in educational background of our students we have divided the series into seven parts. 
You can take the entire series or individual courses that interest you. 
If you are a statistician you should consider skipping the first two or three courses, similarly, if you are biologists you should consider skipping some of the introductory biology lectures. 
Note that the statistics and programming aspects of the class ramp up in difficulty relatively quickly across the first three courses. 
By the third course will be teaching advanced statistical concepts such as hierarchical models and by the fourth advanced software engineering skills, such as parallel computing and reproducible research concepts.
